### Playing

A fully built version of Ships Client is in <code>/dist</code>, note that PixiJS requires a web server to run.


### Developing & Building

Make sure to grab a version of [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/releases) before developing or building! Place the <code>pixi.mjs</code> file under <code>/src</code>.

I used v8.4.0 of the PixiJS Development Build.
```
npm run build
```
