# Ships Client

A fully built version of Ships Client is in /dist, note that PixiJS requires a web server to develop locally.

## Building

Make sure to grab a version of [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/releases) before building! Place the pixi.mjs file under /src.

I used v8.4.0 of the Development Build.
